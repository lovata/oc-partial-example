# Pagination

This is basic example of pagination implementation. 

- Place the pagination in a <nav> element when you can.

- The markup includes an aria-label="pagination" to describe the type of navigation.

- Add aria-current="page" to the link that points to the current page. This will tell AT that the focused link is pointing to the current page.
- Add aria-disabled="true" to the link when the link is disabled.
